## Installation

To get CryptoWorld up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

  * **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
  * **npm** (Node Package Manager, typically comes with Node.js) or **Yarn**

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/CryptoWorld.git
    cd CryptoWorld
    ```

    (Replace `YourUsername` with your actual GitHub username)

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if you use Yarn
    # yarn install
    ```

-----

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server.

```bash
npm start
# or if you use Yarn
# yarn start
```

This will typically open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`. You can then navigate through the home page, explore cryptocurrency details, and check out the exchanges.

-----

## API Key

This project primarily utilizes the **CoinGecko API**. Most of the endpoints for fetching global stats, coin lists, individual coin data, trending coins, and exchanges are publicly accessible and **do not require an API key** for basic usage.

*If you are fetching news from a specific News API that requires a key:*
You might need to obtain an API key from the respective news provider (e.g., NewsAPI, a specific Crypto News API).

**Important:** Do not hardcode your API keys directly into the source code, especially if this project is public. Instead, use environment variables:

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project (same level as `package.json`).
2.  Add your API key(s) to this file, ensuring they are prefixed with `REACT_APP_` for React to pick them up, e.g.:
    ```
    REACT_APP_NEWS_API_KEY=your_actual_news_api_key_here
    ```
3.  Access this variable in your React code using `process.env.REACT_APP_NEWS_API_KEY`.
